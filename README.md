# QuidStreamAssistant

cross-platform app to make it easy to add score-reporting, time-reporting and other information to a Quidditch Livestream.

Haven't gotten to how it's going to work exactly yet, but in theory it will output constantly updating webpages (HTML/CSS) that can be overlaid onto the livestream in the livestreaming software (such as OBS).

More when I have actually written anything.
